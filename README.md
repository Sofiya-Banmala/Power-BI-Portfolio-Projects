## Features  
- **Student Breakdown by Grade** – Shows the distribution of students across different grades (A, B, C).  
- **Student Enrollment Trends** – Displays how student enrollment has changed over the years.  
- **Payment Methods Analysis** – Compares the number of students using different payment methods like credit card, cash, online payment, and bank transfer.  
- **Student Subject Distribution** – Highlights student enrollment in different subjects (Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Science) across various countries.  
- **Total Student Count** – Provides a summary of student registrations over time.  

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.  
- **Microsoft Excel / SQL** – Used for data cleaning and preparation.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculations and data modeling in Power BI.  
- **Power Query** – Used for transforming and structuring data.  

## Dataset Information  
The dataset contains the following details:  
- **Student ID**  
- **Student Country**  
- **Subjects** (Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Science)  
- **Grades** (A, B, C)  
- **Enrollment Date**  
- **Payment Method**  

## Insights from the Data  
- Most students received **Grade A (40%)**, followed by **Grade B (38%)** and **Grade C (21%)**.  
- Student enrollment was **highest in 2020** but saw a decline in later years.  
- Payment methods are **evenly distributed**, meaning students use multiple options to pay their fees.  
- Student enrollment varies **by country and subject**, showing different educational interests.
